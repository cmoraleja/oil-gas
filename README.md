The data set we will use comes from a University of Kansas class exercise on the Hugoton and Panoma gas fields.
The data set consists of seven features
(five wireline log measurements
two indicator variables- last 2
a facies label at half-foot depth intervals.(Shale ( Sandstone , Limestone etc)

In machine learning terminology, the set of measurements at each depth interval comprises a feature vector, each of which is associated with a class (the facies type).
Gamma ray (GR)
Resistivity (ILD_log10)
Photoelectric effect (PE)
Neutron-density porosity difference (DeltaPHI)
Average neutron-density porosity (PHIND)
Nonmarine/marine indicator (NM_M)
Relative position (RELPOS)
